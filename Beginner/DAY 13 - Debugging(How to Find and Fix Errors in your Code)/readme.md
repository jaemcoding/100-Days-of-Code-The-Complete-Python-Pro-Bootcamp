# 1. Debugging Odd or Even
- Read the code in exercise.py - Spot the problems üêû. - Modify the code to fix the program. Fix the code so that it works and passes the tests when you submit.

You can copy and paste the code into PyCharm to help you debug. 

# 2. Debugging Leap Year
- Read the code in exercise.py

- Spot the problems üêû.

- Modify the code to fix the program.   

Fix the code so that it works and when you hit submit it should pass all the tests. 

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

- on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

- unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

You can paste the code into PyCharm to help you debug.

# 3. Debugging FizzBuzz
- Read the code in exercise.py

- Spot the problems üêû. 

- Modify the code to fix the program. 

- No shortcuts 

- don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a previous working solution.   

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.   

- Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number. 

- However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".   

- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 

- And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
